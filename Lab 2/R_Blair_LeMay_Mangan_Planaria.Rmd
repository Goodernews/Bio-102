abstract: "Planaria (Genus Phylum) is a remarkable invertabrate that has the ability to regenerate within a few days of being halved. Planaria are of key interest to biologists because their signaling pathways is highly similar to humans. The process by which the Planaria are able to split and recreate vital appendages is hypothesized to be linked to calcium homeostasis. This lab exposes Planaria to PZQ (Praziquantel) to further understand the planaria's re-formation process."

# Figures

> Figure and Figure legend: Multi-panel figure that includes at least two plots of the data. The best figures will also include images of control and experimental planaria. Label the graph(s) and images sequentially with letters (ie: Panel A, Panel B). 


## Setup

This lab used a dissection microscope....

### Planaria

The Planaria are recognizable because....

## Observations

Over time.... PICTURES OF REGENERATING


Below are sever elements from the lab...


# Observations

Observations were performed on the following schedule:

```{r}
watch_schedule %>%
  kable()
```



# Analysis


## Stastics

 
Statistical summary statements: At least two statistics summary statements that showcase the results from your (i) ANOVA or two-way ANOVA and (ii) chi-squared contingency analysis. See Bio Binder H-10 and H-12 for instructions and examples on how to write a summary statement, in addition to the relevant sections for ANOVA and chi-squared analyses for relevant numbers to report.
