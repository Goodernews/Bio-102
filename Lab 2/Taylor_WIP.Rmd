abstract: "Planaria (Genus Phylum) is a remarkable invertabrate that has the ability to regenerate within a few days of being halved. Planaria are of key interest to biologists because their signaling pathways involved in development is highly similar to humans. The process by which the Planaria are able to split and recreate vital appendages is hypothesized to be linked to calcium homeostasis. This lab exposes Planaria to PZQ (Praziquantel) to further understand the planaria's re-formation process."

# Introduction

This Lab investigated the link between PZQ and regeneration in 

## Planria


Planaria have been used in many research settings with studies ranging from drug tolerance studies (@raffa2001cocaine), memory transfer (@hartry1964planaria), and ... They have been most notably studied for their neoblast system which is ....

## PZQ (Praziquantel)

Praziquantel, often shortened to PZQ, is a drug created by GSK and Pfizer... It is most notably used as an antiparasitic drug discovered in (@wikipediaPlanaria).

Although not directly related to this lab, there is a body of research investigating parasites slowly evolving to become drug resistant to PZQ. In a 2016 study by a group of researchers from Portugal studying Schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease that kills 280,000 annually, investigated the difference of resistant parasites versus non resistant parasites. What they obsereved was a morphological difference between the two groups (@pinto2016morphological).

## Lab Setup

The Planaria were provided by the Reed Biology Department. Planaria were  This lab used a dissection microscope to aid in 


## Data

Data was collected in this lab on a daily basis from February 3rd to Feburuary 10th (see @ref(tab:watch-schedule) for the watch schedule). Observations were performed using a dissection microscope (See figure)

```{r}

watch_schedule <- read_csv("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Xwmnsy9RjIsFgfj2WjAcA4h1AzYWQaRr06DwQG8A9mI/gviz/tq?tqx=out:csv&sheet=watch-schedule")


group_data <- read_csv("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Xwmnsy9RjIsFgfj2WjAcA4h1AzYWQaRr06DwQG8A9mI/gviz/tq?tqx=out:csv&sheet=data-collection")

class_data <- class_data %>%

# Analysis

After collecting the data the authors of this paper aggregated their data with other members of their lab group


## Research Questions

The authors considered a number of potential research questions including:

## Stastics


*Note: The threshold of significance used in this lab is $p < 0.05$*
 
>Statistical summary statements: At least two statistics summary statements that showcase the results from your (i) ANOVA or two-way ANOVA and (ii) chi-squared contingency analysis. See Bio Binder H-10 and H-12 for instructions and examples on how to write a summary statement, in addition to the relevant sections for ANOVA and chi-squared analyses for relevant numbers to report. 


### PZQ impact on regrowth

```{r}

table(tolower(heads_data$Treatment), heads_data$`New Pharynx appearance on HEAD (Y/N)`)


chisq.test(tolower(heads_data$Treatment), heads_data$`New Pharynx appearance on HEAD (Y/N)`)


```


```{r}
table(tolower(tails_data$Treatment), tails_data$`New Eye spot appearance on TAIL (Y/N)`)


chisq.test(tolower(tails_data$Treatment), tails_data$`New Eye spot appearance on TAIL (Y/N)`)
```

```{r}

class_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Treatment, fill = regrowth)) +
  geom_bar() +
  facet_wrap(~segment) +
  labs(title = "Regrowth by treatmant and segment")
